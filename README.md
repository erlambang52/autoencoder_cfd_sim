Predict Flow Pattern with CNN & Autoencoder
This project aims to predict fluid flow patterns in a simple 2D system by integrating Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Autoencoder. The input to the model consists of the geometry representation of the system, while the output is the desired fluid flow pattern. The integration of CNN and Autoencoder techniques helps analyze the relationship between geometry and flow patterns, enabling faster predictions.
